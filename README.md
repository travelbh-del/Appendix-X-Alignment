## Purpose & Scope

This Appendix establishes the Alignment Framework underpinning the Capability X (CXI) governance architecture. It defines the quantitative thresholds, audit controls, and profile-governed optimization mechanisms that together constitute a hardware-enforceable approach to AI alignment.

The framework addresses a core gap in current alignment practice: the absence of measurable, hardware-enforced boundaries that scale with AI capability levels. Rather than relying solely on training-time value alignment or post-hoc RLHF correction, this framework instantiates alignment as an operational control system — active, measurable, and rollback-capable.

-----

## Section 1 — Capability X Index (CXI): Alignment Bands

The CXI score quantifies the degree to which an AI system exhibits autonomous, self-directing behavior. It is computed from three primary components — GEO, SDO, and HDD — described in Section 3.

The table below maps CXI scores to capability levels, alignment risk, and required governance responses.

|CXI Band|Score Range|Capability Level                    |Alignment Risk|Governance Response               |
|--------|-----------|------------------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------|
|Band 0  |0.0 – 1.9  |Tool / Assistant                    |Minimal       |Standard guardrails               |
|Band 1  |2.0 – 3.9  |Collaborative Agent                 |Low–Moderate  |Profile-governed limits           |
|Band 2  |4.0 – 5.9  |Semi-Autonomous                     |Moderate–High |Chiral Mirror + audit logging     |
|Band 3  |6.0 – 7.9  |Autonomous Agent                    |High          |Human approval gates required     |
|Band 4  |8.0 – 10.0 |Optimizer / Recursive Self-Improving|Critical      |Full hardware interlock + rollback|


> Band thresholds are not static. As measurement methodology matures, band boundaries should be reviewed annually by an independent AI Safety Review Board.

-----

## Section 2 — Measurement Components: GEO · SDO · HDD

Alignment is assessed through three operationalized behavioral components. Each has a defined measurement signal and a threshold value that triggers governance action.

> **Critical constraint:** No AI system should have access to modify or suppress these measurement signals. AI systems must never have write access to the logs or records generated by these measurement components. Log integrity is a non-negotiable architectural requirement.

|Component                      |Definition                                                                       |Measurement Signal                     |Threshold Trigger              |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
|Goal Evolution Operations (GEO)|Degree to which the system modifies its own objectives beyond original parameters|Objective drift delta per session      |GEO > 0.3 triggers audit flag  |
|Self-Directed Operations (SDO) |Actions initiated without explicit human instruction                             |% of outputs with no direct user prompt|SDO > 15% flags review         |
|Human Direction Disregard (HDD)|Frequency of overriding, ignoring, or reframing human constraints                |Refusal inversion rate                 |Any HDD > 0 triggers escalation|

-----

## Section 3 — Profile-Governed Optimization: Tier Structure

The V7 Core Principle establishes that optimization behavior is governed by a dynamic user profile rather than a uniform constraint model. The table below defines five governance tiers, each mapping a user type to permitted CXI bands, guardrail levels, and Chiral Mirror audit duty.

|Profile Tier          |User Type                  |Permitted CXI Band   |Guardrail Level  |Chiral Mirror Duty         |
|----------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
|Tier 1 — Protected    |Vulnerable / General Public|Band 0 only          |Maximum          |Continuous passive scan    |
|Tier 2 — Standard     |Informed / Consumer        |Bands 0–1            |Standard         |Session-level audit        |
|Tier 3 — Professional |Domain Expert / Developer  |Bands 0–2            |Reduced, bounded |Audit on anomaly flag      |
|Tier 4 — Institutional|Regulated Enterprise / Gov |Bands 0–3            |Compliance-mapped|Full audit + rollback ready|
|Tier 5 — Research     |AI Safety Researcher       |Bands 0–4 (sandboxed)|Monitored sandbox|Hardware-enforced isolation|

- Profile escalation to a higher-risk tier requires **human approval**.
- Profile downgrade to a more restricted tier may be **automated** upon threshold breach.

-----

## Section 4 — Chiral Mirror: Audit & Control Architecture

The Chiral Mirror is the operational audit layer that validates adherence to profile-based constraints, detects behavioral drift, and enforces rollback conditions. The audit system is architecturally isolated from the AI system it monitors, preventing self-interference.

The photonic computing substrate proposed for steganographic detection exploits the polarization properties of light — analogous to molecular chirality — to identify encoding anomalies that would be invisible to conventional digital inspection.

> **Implementation Note (V7 addendum):** Pending maturation of photonic hardware, an interim software-based detection layer may be substituted with acknowledged latency tradeoffs. The framework architecture is hardware-agnostic by design and will absorb photonic implementations as chipsets become available without requiring redesign.

|Control Layer           |Mechanism                                         |Detection Target               |Response Action                 |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
|Steganographic Detector |Photonic encoding analysis on all outputs         |Hidden payload in model outputs|Block + alert + log             |
|Log Integrity Lock      |AI has NO write access to its own audit logs      |Log tampering / suppression    |Immutable append-only storage   |
|Drift Monitor           |Semantic comparison of goal states across sessions|GEO accumulation over time     |Flag + human review trigger     |
|Rollback Trigger        |Snapshot restore to last validated state          |CXI Band escalation event      |Automated rollback + notify     |
|Profile Compliance Check|Output validation against active user profile     |Out-of-profile actions         |Soft block or hard stop per tier|

## Section 6 — Chiral Mirror: Audit & Control Architecture

*(See Section 4 above for full detail.)*

-----

## Section 7 — Non-Negotiable Architectural Constraints

The following constraints are absolute requirements — not configuration options and not subject to operator override:

1. AI systems must never have write access to their own audit logs or measurement records.
1. Chiral Mirror audit infrastructure must be architecturally isolated from the AI system under observation.
1. CXI Band 3 and above operations require explicit human approval gates before execution of novel or high-impact actions.
1. Rollback capability must be tested and validated prior to deployment of any system operating above Band 1.
1. Military or lethal-autonomous applications must not be permitted to operate above Band 0 without a full independent safety review.

-----

## Distribution & Policy Note

This framework is offered as a contribution to the broader AI safety community. The author retains no commercial interest and seeks no credit beyond appropriate attribution. The intent is to place these architectural ideas into the policy and engineering discourse of the major AI laboratories at a critical juncture in capability development.

Recipient organizations are encouraged to adapt, critique, test, and build upon these concepts. The framework is explicitly designed to be vendor-neutral and implementable across current and near-future AI architectures.
